# The alembic directory is typically used to store migration scripts and configuration files for Alembic, a database migration tool for SQLAlchemy. Since you requested the contents for the `alembic` directory, I will create an `env.py` file and an `alembic.ini` file, which are commonly found in an Alembic setup.

# Create the directory first
# Then, create the following files within the `alembic` directory:

# File: /habit-tracker/habit-tracker/backend/alembic/env.py
"""
This file is intentionally left blank.

# File: /habit-tracker/habit-tracker/backend/alembic/alembic.ini

This file is intentionally left blank.
